Aarohan - The Annual Techno Management Fest presents Behind the Dots. We heartily welcome you to this maze of thrill and excitement!</p>

                     <p>1. There will be three rounds in 'Behind the Dots. You have to make a team of four members to be able to participate in this event. All the teams that register for the event will get to sit in the first round. </p>

                                              <p>2. <b>First Round:</b> The first round will comprise of audio-visual

                                              questions testing your general acumen. Based on the final

                                              scores at the end of the first round, top six teams will qualify

                                              for the second round.</p>


        </div>
          <p>3.<b> Second Round:</b>


          <li>In the second round, the teams will have to look for 'dots'

          which will be hidden all over a place inside the campus (this

          place will be revealed to the participants on-the-spot).</li>

          <li>These dots will have 4X4 grid-mazes containing questions to

          be answered in a stipulated time, finding the best path

          possible. </li>

          <li> At the end of the maze there will be a riddle pointing to a

          particular place in the campus.</li>

          <li> If the teams are able to solve their respective riddles, they rush

          to that place, find clues to guess three commercial products. </li>

          <li>The score at the end of this round will decide which four teams

          out of the six qualify for the final round.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>4. <b>Final Round:</b> On successfully deciphering the clues correctly,

          the teams will get to choose one of the products to make a

          spoof about. The team that manages to entertain the audience

          the most and grabs the maximum marks from the jury and is

          able to score the cumulative maximum points, bags the title of

          the winning team!
