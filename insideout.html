          <p>
To reach the end of the road you happen to take accidently, you have to
complete certain tasks as well as stop the other person from getting into your way and at
the same time don't let the other one reach the end before you do!!!</p>
<b> Event Description:</b>
<p>
Participants have to design a robot which can be controlled manually.
Robot must have ability to move on rough terrains Robot must also be
equipped with a hand mechanism that can pick and place objects and
have a hook too.
</p>
<b>GAME PLAY</b>
<p>
There will be two teams A and B. Both the teams have to complete the
given task in minimum time possible and simultaneously kill time for the
other team
Team A runs on the outer track whereas team B on the inner track for
round 1.
The timer starts as soon as the bots start from the area demarcated as
"start".
The timer stops as soon as one of the teams completes all the given tasks
whereas the other team is left devoid of time and thus loses.
For the next round. team A runs on the inner track and team B on the outer

track
There will be common gates in the arena at certain stops. The team which
reaches the gate first will close the gate for the other team for a duration of
10 seconds.
</p>
<b>THE OUTER ARENA</b>
<p>
Team A starts from the START and moves on a rough terrain and climbs
up an incline. there is a bridge made up of bricks, the bot balances itself
and moves past it, then the bot climbs up on a trolley, there is a
conducting rod, the bot pushes the rod to complete a circuit which
moves the trolley and the bot along, to a broken bridge. the bot picks
up the remaining parts of the bridge to complete it and moves on the
bridge to an incline.
Then the bot moves on rough terrains towards the common gate as
soon as possible.
Now, the bot moves towards a plank to be lifted up using the hook to
complete the path and moves on the plank.
Next, is a common gate to be reached in minimum time possible, few
rough terrains and the end of the task.
</p>
<b>THE INNER ARENA</b>
<p>
There is a container with water, the bot picks and drops small boxes
into the container to increase the water level, water flows through the
pipes to another container which opens a gate, and the bot moves past
it.
The bot now moves quickly to the common gate.
Next, the bot moves down the incline to a conveyer belt running in a

direction opposite to that desired for the bot, the bot balances itself
and moves further
He bot picks up another box nearby which opens another gate and
clears the way, and the bot climbs up the incline further
The bot now places he box picked up earlier to open another gate and
moves further.
Now the bot has to hoist a flag to mark the completion of the tasks
