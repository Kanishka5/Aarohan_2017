        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Vaishali Neotia is the  Co-founder and CEO of Merxius,
an award-winning, innovative products startup specializing in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR & VR), aims at teleporting people to another world which they are unable to experience on their own like reading books did for her. Vaishali elaborates that the applications of AR & VR are not just limited to gaming which they are stereotypically associated with but are vast and unexplored. Their VR solution RED applies this technology to real life and helps customers experience their potential home. Merxius has been ranked among the top 5 innovators in the world and its journey there has been embedded with innumerable obstacles which did not deter its CEO from taking the company to its present heights as she believes that entrepreneurship isn't just about starting up, it's the ability to think and forge a path when none appears, it's the willingness to stick around even when the odds weigh heavy. Merxius is an Aegis Graham Bell award winner. It has also received honours from IBM, Tata Elxsi, IET, UKTI Tech Rocketship among others. Inspiratie 2017 is proud to host her in Aarohan.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Hailing from Kerala, Arun George is the founder and CEO of Avant Garde Innovations, which is a pioneering cleantech start up company newly established in India with the aim of ending energy poverty especially in all carbon intensive economies.

In the Seventh Clean Energy Ministerial at San Francisco, Arun showcased the affordable, portable wind turbine his Thiruvananthapuram-based startup Avant Garde Innovations has built. His was the only Indian clean energy startup at the meet, which brought together investors and public and private organizations. Avant Garde, which was started in January 2015, was among six companies that made a commitment to sustainability through renewable energy, and the pledge got it a mention in a White House press release on energy management. Arun and his brother and co-founder Anoop also took their startup to the Climate Summit in Paris, where it was one of the two Indian companies (the other was Infosys) that committed to building renewable energy solutions.

Apart from receiving many acclolades for his startup, Arun also established the first UN Global Compact State Chapter in Kerala and was also the part of Kerala State Planning Board which formulated the XIII five year plan. Inspiratie 2017 is proud to host him in Aarohan.
